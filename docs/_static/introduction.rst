Getting Started with this test
==============================

Sphinx is made with reStructured text.
It is a bit different than markdown.

* This is some wild stuff right here.
* directives use ":"
* it is quite annoying to get used to

Some math
---------

.. math::

   \frac{ \sum_{t=0}^{N}f(t,k) }{N}

That was some math. I bet it looks cool.
Every tool I have for previewing this sucks.

Using markdown
--------------

`Markdown may be used at the cost of some advanced functionalities <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html>`_



`Blog post of some nerd ranting about it <http://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2016/mar/15/dont-use-markdown-for-technical-docs/>`_

**Main points:**

* Markdown has no set standard

    * There are a million interpreters with millions of syntax

* Harder to expand

    * May rely on CSS stuff
    * Breaks portability for other tools

*Basically,*

**reStructured text is awful to write but is more
stable and standard for documentation**
