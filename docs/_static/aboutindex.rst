The index.rst file
------------------

This file is located within the `docs` root and creates the
table of contents (TOC) for displaying next to the page.

`index.rst <https://github.com/lucasgcb/SphinxTest/blob/test/docs/index.rst>`_


While not mandatory, this helps with navigation quite a bit.

Unfortunately, the index.rst is much more difficult to
automate as it is the basic source file of Sphinx.

If a new modules is created, its path needs to be written down in
the index.rst file for it to show up in the TOC.
